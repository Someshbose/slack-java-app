#Slack java app

We can create slack app using 2 ways

1. Bolt framework 

2. From scratch 

Here I have used bolt framework . You need bolt dependencies to be added. I have implemeted it through Spring App.

##To execute it on slack.
 
You need ngrok which is sort of DNS like tool for local

```shell

```

You need to add your app's(which is registered in slack) SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET in app environemnt 

Then your app is good to go. Some screenshots I will attach here.
